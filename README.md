# AtliQ_Mart_Promotion_Analysis
In this project, we conducted an analysis of promotional activities carried out during the Diwali and Sankranti festivals using Power BI. The aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of these activities, identifying successful and unsuccessful promotion. Additionally, we performed ad-hoc analyses as requested by senior executives.
